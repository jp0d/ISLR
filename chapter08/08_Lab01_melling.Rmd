We must estimate the test error rather than simply computing the training error. We split the observations into a training set and a test set, build the tree using the training set, and evaluate its performance on the test data. The predict() function can be used for this purpose. In the case of a classification tree, the argument type="class" instructs R to return the actual class prediction. This approach leads to correct predictions for around 71.5 % of the locations in the test data set.
```{r}
set.seed(2)
train=sample(1:nrow(Carseats), 200)
Carseats.test=Carseats[-train ,]
High.test=High[-train]
tree.carseats=tree(High~.-Sales, Carseats, subset=train)
tree.pred=predict(tree.carseats, Carseats.test, type="class")
table(tree.pred,High.test)
```
Book result

High.test
tree.pred  No Yes 
        No 86 27 
       Yes 30 57
> (86+57) /200 [1] 0.715

```{r}
(104 + 50)/200
```
## Prune Tree

We use the argument FUN=prune.misclass in order to indicate that we want the classification error rate to guide the cross-validation and pruning process, rather than the default for the cv.tree() function, which is deviance.

```{r}
set.seed(3)
cv.carseats =cv.tree(tree.carseats, FUN=prune.misclass)
names(cv.carseats)
```

```{r}
cv.carseats
```

Note that, despite the name, dev corresponds to the cross-validation error rate in this instance. The tree with 9 terminal nodes results in the lowest cross-validation error rate, with 50 cross-validation errors. We plot the error rate as a function of both size and k.
```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(cv.carseats$size, cv.carseats$dev, type="b")
plot(cv.carseats$k, cv.carseats$dev, type="b")
```

```{r}
prune.carseats=prune.misclass(tree.carseats,best=9)
{plot(prune.carseats )
text(prune.carseats,pretty=0)
}
```

```{r}
tree.pred=predict(prune.carseats,Carseats.test,type="class")
table(tree.pred ,High.test)
```

77% of the test observations are correctly classified, so not only has the pruning process produced a more interpretable tree, but it has also improved the classification accuracy
```{r}
(97+58)/200
```

```{r}
prune.carseats=prune.misclass(tree.carseats, best=15)
{plot(prune.carseats)
text(prune.carseats, pretty=0)
}
tree.pred=predict(prune.carseats,Carseats.test,type="class")
table(tree.pred ,High.test)

```
