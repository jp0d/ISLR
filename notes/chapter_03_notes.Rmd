## Linear Regression

Machine Learning: Start with linear regression

“a very simple approach for supervised learning”

“widely used statistical learning method”

$$y = Mx + b$$
Written as $$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x$$

y is called response or target 
x predictor

Once we know betas we can predict value of response 

Minimize the total error from each point to our line. 

Bend the line to fit better

Simple Linear one variable 

“We typically assume that the error term is independent of X.”
