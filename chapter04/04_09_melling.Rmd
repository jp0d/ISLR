This problem has to do with odds.

# 9a

(a) On average, what fraction of people with an odds of 0.37 of
defaulting on their credit card payment will in fact default?

```
Given .37 odds

odds = p(X )/  1âˆ’p(X)

.37 = p / 1 - p
(1-p).37 = p
.37 - .37 p= p
.37 = 1.37p
```

```{r}
p = .37/1.37
p # = .27 # 27%
```

# 9b

(b) Suppose that an individual has a 16% chance of defaulting on her credit card payment. What are the odds that she will de- fault?

Given 16%
```{r}
odds = .16 /(1 - .16)
odds # .19 odds
```
