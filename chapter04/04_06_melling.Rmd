# Question

p170

Suppose we collect data for a group of students in a statistics class with variables X1 = hours studied, X2 = undergrad GPA, and Y = receive an A. We fit a logistic regression and produce estimated coefficient, $\hat{\beta_0} = âˆ’6, \hat{\beta_1} = 0.05, \hat{\beta_2} = 1$.

(a) Estimate the probability that a student who studies for 40 h and has an undergrad GPA of 3.5 gets an A in the class.
(b) How many hours would the student in part (a) need to study to have a 50 % chance of getting an A in the class?

See page 134-135

Use the Logistic Regression Formula Y=e^x/(1+e^x)  x = b0 + b1*x1 + b2*x2
```
Y = e^ b0 + b1 * x1
    ----------------
    1 + e^ b0 + b1 * x1
```

# 6a

b0 = -6
b1 = .05
b2 = 1

x1 = 40
x2 = 3.5
```
y0 = b0 + b1 * x1 + b2 * x2
y0
y = exp(y0)/(1 + exp(y0))
```

y # 0.3775407 = 37.7%

# 6b

Use the Logistic Regression Formula 

$$Y=e^x/(1+e^x) \\
x = b0 + b1*x1 + b2*x2$$

- Y = 0.5
- x2 = 3.5 (from a)

```
0.5 = e^-6 + 0.05X + 1*3.5
      ------------------------
      1 + e^-6 + 0.05X + 1*3.5
```

```
(1 + e^-6 + 0.05X + 1*3.5) * 0.5 = e^-6 + 0.05X + 1*3.5
(0.5 + 0.5 * (e^-6 + 0.05X + 1*3.5)   = e^-6 + 0.05X + 3.5
0.5 = 0.5 * e^-6 + 0.05X + 3.5
1 = e^-6 + 0.05X + 3.5
log(1) = log(e^-6 + 0.05X + 3.5)
0 = -6 + 0.05X + 3.5
0 = -2.5 + 0.05X
2.5 = 0.05X
50 = X
```

Solve for x1
Will be taking the log of both sides

log(1) # 0
x1 = 50
